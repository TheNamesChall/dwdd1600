        <h2>This Site:</h2>
        <p>This website is designed to showcase the works of myself, the creator of this site, Caeden Hall, and serve as a portfolio of sorts. Hosted here are various different pieces of art created by me, ranging from 2D as well as 3D works, including the programs that were used to create them.</p>

        <h2>My Work:</h2>
        <p>Most of the work here will be 2d in nature, as that is my main area of expertise, the one that I have the most experience in, however I do also know some other forms of art, including 3d modelling and video editing. I have made some youtube videos as part of a side hobby, but those will not be showcased here as they are largely lower effort "for fun" projects.</p>
