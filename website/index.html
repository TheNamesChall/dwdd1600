        <p>Here is a rundown of the programs listed above and how I use them.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Krita</dt>
            <dd>This is my main art program. It is somewhat similar to photoshop but is more focused on illustration and art than image editing. It is also significantly more stable and less resource intensive than photoshop in my expereince so that is a part of why I use it so often.</dd>
            <dt>Adobe Illustrator</dt>
            <dd>Adobe Illustrator is my main vector based software. I use it to make scalable assets for my designs.</dd>
            <dt>Davinci Resolve</dt>
            <dd>Resolve could honestly be replaced with Adobe After Effects as they're both video editing programs, but I've been using Resolve for longer so it's the one that I'm the most comfortable with.</dd>
            <dt>Blender</dt>
            <dd>Blender is the main program that I use for 3D modelling. While I do know how to use Cinema 4D as well as a little bit of Maya, both of those are very expensive as well as not open source, so I stick with Blender for the most part.</dd>
